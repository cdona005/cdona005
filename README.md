### EduSense

EduSense is an AI-powered tutoring and learning support platform designed to help students understand course material through automated content ingestion and guided interaction.

The system allows users to upload documents and assignments, converts them into structured formats, and provides contextual tutoring using large language models.

Tech stack and features:
- Java backend for core services and data handling
- Django + React/TypeScript frontend
- SQLite for persistence
- LLM integration for tutoring and question answering
- Automated document ingestion and parsing
- Modular architecture for future expansion

This project demonstrates full-stack development, system design, and integration of AI services into a practical application.
